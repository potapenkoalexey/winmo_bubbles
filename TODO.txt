1. integrate project for Android Studio (use cmake to prepare files)
2. review render system for correct objects scaling and rotation 
    (now it scale and rotating relative to the center of screen coordinates). 
    it will be easy to work with texture and animation.
3. fix sound driver and device selecting on Win10/Linux
4. win installer:
    4.1 update internal pictures
    4.2 ask user about rewriting config file
    4.3 do not remove config file on uninstall
5. Move ini_handler class from engine to game


to program refactoring we need to:
a) isolate ini handling into separate cpp
    a1) isolate all file operation in separate 
    a2) separate settings.ini into two files between game and engine
    a3) prepare and create separate library 
    a4) create conan package (if needed)
b) refactoring program due to resolve dependencies between engine and game
